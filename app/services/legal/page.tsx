It offers confidentiality, party autonomy in the choice of governing law and procedure, and, where institutional rules are properly incorporated into the underlying contract, a degree of procedural predictability that litigation rarely matches.",

Access to this level of representation at the right moment can determine outcomes that no other legal mechanism could produce.",
